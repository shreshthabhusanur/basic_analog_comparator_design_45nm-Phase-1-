# basic_analog_comparator_design_45nm-Phase-1-
This project presents the Phase-1 design and analysis of a basic analog comparator using 45 nm CMOS technology. It focuses on understanding core comparator operation, transistor-level implementation, and key performance parameters such as gain, delay, and power, forming the foundation for advanced low-power designs.
